A motivated and driven software developer with an interest in improving life through tech. Recently graduated from Makers Academy, I have a proven ability to write quality, test-driven code. I continue to develop my tech knowledge via working on personal projects, taking part in hackathons, going to tech meetups and attending industry conferences and webinars. 

A self-driven and proactive person, accustomed to working in a variety of challenging and pressurised work environments including 8 years in the hospitality industry and 14 years in the publishing sector. I have embraced diverse experiences and perspectives and have a demonstrative ability to adapt, continually grow and develop whilst progressing in my career.  

My career so far has required the ability to think flexibly and creatively, coupled with continual problem solving, analytical, logical and higher thinking. All skills which have been essential in my transition to coding.
