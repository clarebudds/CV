I am a motivated and driven software developer with an interest in improving life through tech. Recently graduated from Makers Academy, I have a proven ability to write quality, test-driven code. I continue to develop my tech knowledge via working on personal projects, taking part in hackathons, going to tech meetups and attending industry conferences and webinars. 
 
My career experience in the publishing sector and hospitality industry, has required the ability to think flexibly and creatively, coupled with continual problem solving, analytical, and logical thinking. All skills which have been essential in my transition to coding.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

In my most recent role at Hilton, I participated in daily briefings with the hotel's senior management team, helped lead Hilton's collaboration with the Down Syndrome organisation (spoke on BBC 6 O'Clock news to discuss the partnership) and contributed to social channels (shot and edited a video to promote the hotel's partnership with the Felix Project charity. 

#### Sharing knowledge

I've regularly shared my knowledge by helping to train and support colleagues during my career. Whether it was on software used for payroll, invoicing, sales, desktop publishing (Photoshop, InDesign, QuarkXpress) or by demonstrating and discussing how to make a new dish on the menu during my time as a chef.

#### Thrives under pressure

In my roles in publishing and hospitality, I built a noted ability to work under pressure, working to time critical deadlines in publishing and working efficiently, calmly and with great attention to detail in busy restaurant kitchens. In all my roles, my commitment to producing quality work as a team has been rewarded with company & industry awards and positive reviews from noted restaurant critics.
