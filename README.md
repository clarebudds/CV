I am a motivated and driven software developer with an interest in improving life through tech. Recently graduated from Makers Academy, I have a proven ability to write quality, test-driven code. I continue to develop my tech knowledge via working on personal projects, taking part in hackathons, going to tech meetups and attending industry conferences and webinars. 
 
My career experience in the publishing sector and hospitality industry, has required the ability to think flexibly and creatively, coupled with continual problem solving, analytical, and logical thinking. All skills which have been essential in my transition to coding.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

I have strong written and vocal communication skills, which were used daily during Makers - collaborating with fellow students and co-presenting group projects. In my role at Hilton, I participated in daily briefings with the hotel's senior management team, helped lead Hilton's collaboration with the Down Syndrome organisation (spoke on BBC 6 O'Clock news to discuss the partnership) and contributed to social channels (shot and edited a video to promote the hotel's partnership with the Felix Project charity. During my publishing career, I frequently liaised with internal and external clients to keep them up to date on all elements of projects and built strong, trusted relationships as a result. 

#### Team Player

During my Makers experience, I frequently worked with others, whether it was pairing or working on the group projects together and helped to navigate the daily challenges we faced. I contributed to the camaraderie and rapport of the team to ensure that projects were completed as per the brief and in an enjoyable working environment.

#### Thrives under pressure

In my roles in publishing and hospitality, I built a noted ability to work under pressure, working to time critical deadlines in publishing and working efficiently, calmly and with great attention to detail in busy restaurant kitchens. In all my roles, my commitment to producing quality work as a team has been rewarded with company & industry awards and positive reviews from noted restaurant critics.

#### Self motivated

I enjoy challenging myself and pushing myself to learn and develop. Whether that was completing the Makers bootcamp and keeping hyper-focused during the intensive 4 month course, retraining as a chef and learning quickly on the job in demanding kitchens, or starting new roles and having to create processes and procedures from scratch. I have continued my learning journey post Makers, by completing personal projects and online technical challenges to sharpen my coding skills and technical abilities.

#### Sharing knowledge

I've regularly shared my knowledge by helping to train and support colleagues during my career. Whether it was on software used for payroll, invoicing, sales, desktop publishing (Photoshop, InDesign, QuarkXpress) or by demonstrating and discussing how to make a new dish on the menu during my time as a chef.
